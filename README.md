This repository represents an index to the main projects I developed in the framework of my PhD thesis. I will try to keep updated links to the public repositories, and also, when necessary, a frozen copy of it at my last contribution.

When finished I will include a pdf of the manuscript too.

# Chapter 1: Gitools

Gitools is a framework for analysis and visualization of multidimensional genomic data using interactive heat-maps.
You will find some tutorials in the [main site of the tool](http://www.gitools.org/).

I started this project and was the main contributor until the version 1.5.x.
Afterwards other members of the group continued adding new cool features and fixing bugs until now (2015) where the development still continues.

The source code can be accessed from the public repository [here](https://github.com/gitools/gitools)

# Chapter 2: IntOGen

My main contribution to the IntOGen projects and papers is for the management of the genomic data, its analysis, and making the results available for internal and external researchers.

# Chapter 3: Benchmarking of functional impact predictors

I was working on a benchmark for the performance of several functional impact assessment algorithms, driver mutations identification tools and general purpose conservation scores.
